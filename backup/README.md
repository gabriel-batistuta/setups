# What is this?

this is a part of the repository that takes care of **configuring your PC with your most used programs or programs that you want to install automatically**.

if you switch operating systems often or configure a lot using computers you don't own maybe this repository will be useful for you

_remember to allow the file to run as a program_.

on Linux just give the command **./path-of-backup-file** and it is already executed
