# what is '_essential_'?

essential is a script of backup but with just the **essential**

Ever thought about going to college but **don't want to log in locally with your details on public computers** to use your favorite programs? it's for those **cases where you don't need to configure your entire personal machine** but **only for what you need at the moment**, like an activity or work. in my case I take my pen drive that has an iso with a bootable linux distro and I just **run this script to configure that pc temporarily** and then just unplug it. that is all.
